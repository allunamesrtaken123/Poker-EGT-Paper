# Poker-EGT-Paper

This repository contains data, code, and related files for the paper "Wrong Ways to Win -- Effective Learning in Poker Simulation". I started on this project the summer before my senior 
year of undergrad, and the work has continued into the fall. In this repository one can find code for the simulations ran, the resulting data that was analyzed, and some analysis of the 
data that I did along the way in the form of weekly write-ups. I gave a talk on this work in early September and have included the slides for that talk. Funding was provided by the Baker 
'64 Collabria Fellowship in Data Analysis. I was advised on the project by the wonderful Maryam Gooyabadi and brilliant Nikhil Addleman.

If you are interested in the work don't hesitate to reach out! You can email me at aaronfoote31@gmail.com
